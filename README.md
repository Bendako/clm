# CLM - Continuous Learning for LLMs

A comprehensive automated on-premise system designed to update Large Language Models (LLMs) incrementally while preserving historical knowledge and mitigating catastrophic forgetting.

## Overview

CLM provides a "Continuously Improving LLM Brain" by automating the entire LLM update lifecycle, ensuring models improve over time without losing previously acquired knowledge. It addresses key challenges in maintaining and updating LLMs in production environments.

## Key Features

### Continual Learning & Memory Preservation

- **Anti-Forgetting Technologies**: Advanced continual learning strategies (regularization methods, replay buffers, modular architectures) to protect vital knowledge during retraining.
- **Replay Mechanisms**: Intelligent selection of legacy data for inclusion during model updates.
- **Multi-Task Support**: Unified model with task-specific adapters to maintain performance across varied tasks.

### Automated Pipeline & Monitoring

- **CI/CD for Training**: Automated retraining workflows triggered by data thresholds or performance drift.
- **Smart Scheduling**: Dynamic training schedules based on data volume and detected distribution shifts.
- **Real-time Performance Tracking**: Comprehensive monitoring of model metrics across all tasks.
- **Drift Detection**: Statistical tests to identify data, concept, and prior probability shifts.

### Deployment & Rollback Safety

- **Flexible Deployment Strategies**: Support for blue-green and canary deployments.
- **One-Click Rollback**: Immediate recovery from unintended regressions.
- **Pre-Deployment Validation**: Automated testing against historical tasks before deployment.

### Transparency & Lineage

- **Full Experiment Tracking**: Complete logs of training hyperparameters, data sources, and metrics.
- **Model Registry**: Central repository of all model versions with metadata.
- **Audit Trails**: Detailed history of model updates for regulatory compliance.

## System Architecture

- **Microservices Backend**: RESTful APIs for data ingestion, training, and deployment operations.
- **Data Layer**: 
  - **Ingestion Service**: Handles streaming and batch data collection with metadata tagging.
  - **Version-Controlled Storage**: Delta Lake-like system for data snapshots and change tracking.
- **Training Pipeline**:
  - **Orchestration**: Workflow management via Airflow or Kubeflow.
  - **Containerized Jobs**: Reproducible training environments with Kubernetes.
- **Model Management**:
  - **Registry Integration**: Works with MLflow or DVC for experiment tracking.
